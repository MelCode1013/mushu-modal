      Before Mushu came to my home, he broke his foot. This caused immense stress and he began plucking his feathers.
      After he healed, the "bad habit" stuck. Like nail biting, he finds comfort in breaking off his feathers. He still
      has some follicles so feathers continue to grow in.

    <h1>What a talker!</h1>

    <p>
      Mushu has a vast vocabulary. He says "Alexa", "Hi", "Hello", "What happened?", "Ozzie", "Oh", "Wow", and he laughs
      too!

      Macaws are NOT beginner birds. Their beaks can generate a pressure of 300+ psi with ONE bite. They could easily
      break your finger with enough pressure. So while he looks cute, do your research and above all else...Adopt -
      Don't shop!
